# Diamond Reference Implementations

There there are three diamond reference implementations that have different benefits and disadvantages in terms of code complexity and gas costs.
Here is a simple breakdown of the differences between the three implementations. The ratings (high, medium, low) are in relation to each other.

| Implementation | diamondCut<br>complexity | diamondCut<br>gas cost | loupe<br>complexity | loupe<br>gas cost |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| diamond-1      | low                      | medium                 | medium              | high              |
| diamond-2      | high                     | low                    | high                | high              |
| diamond-3      | medium                   | high                   | low                 | low               |
